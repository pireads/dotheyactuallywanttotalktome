      I have this habit of texting people who reply much less frequently than I
      text them.
      <br />
      I try very hard not to take it personally, but unconsciously it's hard to
      get around sometimes. I just don't want to bother people who don't want to
      be bothered.
      <br />
      I bought this domain with the intention of creating a website where I
      could type in someone's name and find out whether they actually wanted to
      talk to me.
      <br />
      I quickly realized that, while I'm pretty good with computers, I'm not
      that good.
      <br />
      <br />
      Yet.
      <br />
      <br />
      But I think this website will still be useful in its current form as a
      collection of opinions on the topic.
      <br />
      That way, when I inevitably have this question again I can still come back
      here and hopefully get some perspective.

      Randall makes a good point here, as usual.
      <br />
      I didn't notice until my sister pointed out today that when Randall pokes
      people, he's worried that they're secretly putting up with him.
      <br />
      But when people poke Randall, they're just a really nice friend.
      <br />
      I'd been so busy relating to the view that that picture gives that I
      didn't realize how asymmetrical it was.

      This one also comes from my sister.
      <br />
      I think the important thing to note here is that the problem that Dodie is
      having is not with the person on the other end of the line, it's with
      herself.
      <br />
      If you're reading this and you're not me but you think this website was at
      least partially written about you, you should know that I very much agree
      with Dodie on this one.
      <br />
      I'm well aware that there are many reasons that someone might have for
      taking a while to respond to their texts that don't involve whether or not
      they hate me.
      <br />
      But also if you think I might have had you in mind when I wrote this site
      and you actually don't want to hear from me, you should probably tell me.
      <br />
      That way this site can serve its original purpose in at least some
      capacity.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Future Avi,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        People will reply to you when they feel like replying to you, 
        and oftentimes that decision will have absolutley nothing to do with how they feel about you.
        <br/>
        Maybe this wouldn't be an issue
        if you didn't derive so much of your self worth based on other people's perceived opinions of you.
        <br>
        Avi from the past clearly wants to talk to you, and that should be enough.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Or maybe you've already outgrown whatever this is, 
        and you've come here to laugh at how fragile and insecure you used to be.
        <br/>
        Or you've figured out how to make this page solve our original problem and just tell you 
        whether they actually want to talk to you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In either case, congratulations on the personal growth.
    </p>
