      I have this habit of texting people who reply much less frequently than I text them.
      <br />
      I try very hard not to take it personally, but unconsciously it's hard to
      get around sometimes. I just don't want to bother people who don't want to be bothered.
      <br />
      I bought this domain with the intention of creating a website where I
      could type in someone's name and find out whether they actually wanted to
      talk to me.
      <br />
      I quickly realized that, while I'm pretty good with computers, I'm not
      that good.
      <br />
      Yet.
      <br />
      <br />
      But I think this website will still be useful in its current form as a
      collection of opinions on the topic from people that I respect.
      <br />
      That way, when I inevitably have this question again I can still come back
      here and hopefully get some perspective.

      Randall makes a good point here, as usual.
      <br />
      I didn't notice until my sister pointed out today that when Randall pokes
      people, he's worried that they're secretly putting up with him.
      <br />
      But when people poke Randall, they're just a really nice friend.
      <br />
      I've been so busy relating to the view that that picture gives that I
      didn't realize how asymmetrical it was.
